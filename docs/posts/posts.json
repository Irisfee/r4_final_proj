    "description": "In this post we used random forest to train a regression model that uses a set of predictors to predict individual score. The details of feature selection and training the model (including choosing and tuning hyperparmater) will be discussed in a seperate post. To summarize the performance of the random forest regression model: the OOB RMSE for the full training set is 92.48828, the OOB RMSE for the testing set is 100.5576",
