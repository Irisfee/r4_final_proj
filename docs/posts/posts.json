    "description": "In this post, we will discuss how we select predictors used in our model to predicor individual math score. In addition to the original training set, we selected and merged a few extra predictors that are at higher levels, including staff info, school characteristic, lunch eligibility, directory and membership. The exact procedure and rationale behind choosing those predictors are discussed below. \\\nNote that this post only discuss the procedure by which we build up our training set. This post does not include details on feature enginerring. The details of building recipes can be found in each prelim fit post individually.",

    "description": "In this post we used random forest to train a regression model that uses a set of predictors to predict individual score. The details of feature selection and training the model (including choosing and tuning hyperparmater) will be discussed in a seperate post. To summarize the performance of the random forest regression model: the OOB RMSE for the full training set is 92.48828, the OOB RMSE for the testing set is 100.5576",
